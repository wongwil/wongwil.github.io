<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey! My name is William, I'm from Zurich and I am currently studying Computer Science at ETHZ. I have done multiple projects in Machine Learning which can be found on my Github linked at the footer of my blog. If you're interested, go check it out!</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to watch Anime, play online games (mostly Valorant & Chess), Fitness, and solve LeetCode problems.</p>

<p>And this blog is just about my studies, updates about my life and some interesting coding problems. Hope you like it :)</p>
