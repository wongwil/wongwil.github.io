Hey! My name is William, I'm from Zurich and I am currently studying Computer Science at ETHZ. I have done multiple projects in Machine Learning which can be found on my Github linked at the footer of my blog. If you're interested, go check it out! 

In my free time, I like to watch Anime, play online games (mostly Valorant&Chess), Fitness and solve LeetCode problems. 

And this blog is just about my studies, updates about my life and some interesting coding problems. Hope you like it :)
